## About
The **Classic Arcade Game Clone Project** is part of of the Udacity Nanodegree Program **Front-End Web Developer**. Every student has to complete the task on their own. I created the first version of the project in January 2019.

## Instructions

Start the game by opening index.html in your preferred browser.

Your task is to move the character from bottom to top. The enemies (bugs) must not be touched. As soon as you reach the water, the game is won and you get 10 points. For touching the enemy you lose five points.

To move around use your keyboard arrow keys Up, Down, Left and Right.
